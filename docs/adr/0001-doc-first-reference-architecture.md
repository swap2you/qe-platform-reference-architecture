# ADR-0001: Documentation-First Reference Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to define and communicate QE platform standards across multiple test automation repositories. The challenge is ensuring consistency, enforceability, and clarity without creating a monolithic codebase.

Options considered:
- Code templates in a shared repository
- Wiki documentation
- Separate documentation repository
- Documentation-first reference architecture

## Decision

We will use a **documentation-first reference architecture** approach where:
- This repository contains only documentation (no test code)
- Documentation defines explicit contracts and standards
- Implementing repositories reference and comply with these standards
- Compliance is verified through audits and CI/CD checks

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Code Templates Repository

**Description**: Create a repository with code templates that teams copy.

**Pros**:
- Teams get working code immediately
- Less interpretation needed

**Cons**:
- Hard to maintain across multiple repos
- Version drift between repos
- Doesn't scale well

**Decision**: Rejected - maintenance burden too high.

### Option 2: Wiki Documentation

**Description**: Use GitHub Wiki or similar for documentation.

**Pros**:
- Easy to edit
- Version control through Git

**Cons**:
- Hard to enforce standards
- No clear contract definition
- Difficult to audit compliance

**Decision**: Rejected - lacks enforceability.

### Option 3: Separate Documentation Repository

**Description**: Create a dedicated docs repo with standards.

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can be versioned independently

**Cons**:
- May become disconnected from implementation
- Harder to discover

**Decision**: Rejected - prefer co-location with reference architecture.

### Option 4: Documentation-First Reference Architecture (Chosen)

**Description**: Single repository with comprehensive documentation defining contracts, standards, and governance.

**Pros**:
- Clear contract definition
- Enforceable through audits
- Scalable across many repos
- Public-safe and shareable
- Can evolve independently

**Cons**:
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Teams must interpret and implement

**Decision**: Accepted - best balance of clarity, enforceability, and scalability.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clarity**: Explicit contract definition makes expectations clear
- **Enforceability**: Compliance can be verified through audits
- **Scalability**: One reference architecture supports many implementing repos
- **Public-Safe**: Documentation can be shared without proprietary concerns
- **Evolution**: Standards can evolve without breaking implementations

### Negative

- **Interpretation**: Teams must interpret documentation and implement
- **Maintenance**: Documentation must be kept up-to-date
- **Enforcement**: Requires audit process to ensure compliance

### Risks

- **Drift**: Implementing repos may drift from standards over time
- **Outdated Docs**: Documentation may become outdated
- **Incomplete Implementation**: Teams may not fully implement all standards

### Mitigation

- Regular compliance audits (quarterly)
- Versioned contract with change management
- Clear compliance checklist
- Automated CI/CD checks where possible
