# ADR-0002: Quality Gates Separation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to define when different test suites run in the CI/CD pipeline. The challenge is balancing speed (fast feedback) with coverage (comprehensive testing) while preventing bad code from reaching production.

Options considered:

- Single test suite running on all events
- Multiple test suites with different triggers
- Test suite separation by type and trigger

## Decision

We will implement **separated quality gates** with distinct test suites:

- **PR Gate**: Smoke tests (fast, critical path) - blocks PR merge
- **Nightly Gate**: Regression tests (comprehensive) - scheduled execution
- **Release Gate**: Performance and security tests - before release

Each gate has distinct requirements, execution times, and failure handling.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Single Test Suite

**Description**: Run all tests on every PR and nightly.

**Pros**:

- Simple to implement
- Comprehensive coverage always

**Cons**:

- Slow feedback on PRs
- Resource intensive
- May block PRs unnecessarily

**Decision**: Rejected - too slow for PR feedback.

### Option 2: Two Test Suites (PR + Nightly)

**Description**: Smoke tests on PR, full suite nightly.

**Pros**:

- Fast PR feedback
- Comprehensive nightly coverage

**Cons**:

- May miss issues between PR and nightly
- No release-specific gates

**Decision**: Rejected - missing release gates.

### Option 3: Separated Quality Gates (Chosen)

**Description**: Three distinct gates:

- PR: Smoke tests (< 10 min, blocking)
- Nightly: Regression tests (< 60 min, non-blocking)
- Release: Performance + security (blocking)

**Pros**:

- Fast PR feedback
- Comprehensive nightly coverage
- Release-specific validation
- Clear separation of concerns

**Cons**:

- More complex to set up
- Requires discipline to maintain

**Decision**: Accepted - best balance of speed, coverage, and safety.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Fast Feedback**: PRs get quick validation (< 10 minutes)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Nightly runs catch integration issues
- **Release Safety**: Performance and security gates prevent bad releases
- **Clear Expectations**: Each gate has defined purpose and requirements

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More workflows to maintain
- **Resource Usage**: Multiple test executions
- **Coordination**: Need to ensure gates don't conflict

### Risks

- **Gate Bypass**: Teams may bypass gates in emergencies
- **Gate Drift**: Gates may become inconsistent over time
- **False Positives**: Gates may block valid changes

### Mitigation

- Enforce gate requirements in contract
- Regular audit of gate configurations
- Clear exception process documented
- Monitor gate execution metrics
