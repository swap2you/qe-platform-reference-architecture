# ADR-0003: Reporting and Evidence Standard

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a standardized way to generate, store, and access test execution evidence. The challenge is ensuring traceability, accessibility, and consistency across multiple repositories and test types (UI, API, performance).

Options considered:

- Multiple reporting tools (one per test type)
- Custom reporting solution
- Allure as standard reporting tool
- No standard (each repo chooses)

## Decision

We will use **Allure TestOps/Reports as the standard** for all test execution evidence. Every test execution must generate an Allure evidence bundle containing:

- Allure HTML report
- Test execution summary (JSON/XML)
- Artifacts (screenshots, logs, videos)
- Metadata (timestamp, environment, versions)

This standard applies to all test types (UI, API, performance) and all execution contexts (PR, nightly, release).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Multiple Reporting Tools

**Description**: Use different tools for different test types (e.g., Allure for UI, custom for API, JMeter reports for performance).

**Pros**:

- Tool optimized for each test type
- Teams can choose best tool

**Cons**:

- Inconsistent evidence format
- Hard to aggregate metrics
- Multiple tools to learn

**Decision**: Rejected - inconsistency is a major drawback.

### Option 2: Custom Reporting Solution

**Description**: Build custom reporting solution tailored to our needs.

**Pros**:

- Fully customized to requirements
- Complete control

**Cons**:

- High development cost
- Maintenance burden
- May not have all features needed

**Decision**: Rejected - cost and maintenance too high.

### Option 3: Allure as Standard (Chosen)

**Description**: Use Allure TestOps/Reports for all test types and execution contexts.

**Pros**:

- Consistent evidence format
- Rich features (history, trends, attachments)
- Supports UI, API, and performance tests
- Widely adopted and maintained
- Good integration with CI/CD

**Cons**:

- May not be perfect for all test types
- Requires setup and configuration
- Learning curve for teams

**Decision**: Accepted - best balance of features, consistency, and adoption.

### Option 4: No Standard

**Description**: Let each repository choose its own reporting tool.

**Pros**:

- Maximum flexibility
- Teams choose what works best

**Cons**:

- No consistency
- Hard to aggregate metrics
- Difficult to audit compliance

**Decision**: Rejected - lack of consistency is unacceptable.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Consistency**: All repositories use same reporting format
- **Traceability**: Evidence is standardized and accessible
- **Aggregation**: Metrics can be aggregated across repos
- **Rich Features**: Allure provides history, trends, attachments
- **Integration**: Good CI/CD integration

### Negative

- **Setup Required**: Each repo must configure Allure
- **Learning Curve**: Teams must learn Allure
- **Tool Dependency**: Dependent on Allure maintenance

### Risks

- **Tool Changes**: Allure may change or become unsupported
- **Incomplete Implementation**: Teams may not fully implement standard
- **Performance**: Large reports may be slow

### Mitigation

- Version Allure requirements in contract
- Provide configuration templates
- Regular compliance audits
- Monitor report generation performance
